# redav

This package will eventually contain functions, data, and templates to accompany data visualization courses.

If you encounter problems or have questions, please open an [issue](https://github.com/jtr13/redav/issues) or start/contribute to a [discussion](https://github.com/jtr13/redav/discussions).

As of now, it contains two functions: `draw_biplot()` and `plot_missing()`. 

There are other options for drawing biplots in the **ggplot2** framework; `ggbiplot()` in the [**ordr** package](https://github.com/corybrunson/ordr) is an excellent choice. The main contributions of `draw_biplot()` are ease of use and option to calibrate only one of the axes. Calibration calculations are performed by `calibrate()` in the [**calibrate** package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/calibrate/index.html).

Currently, `draw_biplot()` takes a data frame, performs principal components analysis (PCA) on the numeric columns using `prcomp()` and draws a biplot using the first non-numeric column as labels for the principal component scores (points). Additional options besides PCA may be added in the future. 

`plot_missing()` was designed as a replacement for `extracat::visna()` which is no longer available on CRAN. It has improved labeling and the option to label axes as percents or numbers.

## Installation

This package is not on CRAN. Install with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
remotes::install_github("jtr13/redav")
```

## Examples

### `draw_biplot()`

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width = 5, dev='svg'}
library(redav)
draw_biplot(attitude)
draw_biplot(attitude, key_axis = "raises") + 
  ggplot2::ggtitle("The Chatterjee-Price Attitude Data", 
          sub = "package: datasets (base R)")
s77 <- as.data.frame(state.x77)
s77$state_name <- rownames(s77)
draw_biplot(s77)
draw_biplot(s77, key_axis = "Murder", ticklab = 0:16, project = FALSE,
            point_color="lightblue") + ggplot2::theme_classic()
draw_biplot(s77, mult = 1, point_color = "pink")
draw_biplot(s77, points = FALSE)
```

### `plot_missing()`

```{r, fig.height=4, fig.width=7, dev='svg'}
library(redav)
data(CHAIN, package = "mi")
plot_missing(CHAIN)
plot_missing(CHAIN, percent = FALSE)
plot_missing(mtcars)
```
